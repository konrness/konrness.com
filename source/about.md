I am a DevOps and CI/CD engineer in Minneapolis, MN.

I work at [Harness](https://harness.io). There I am a Solutions Engineer where I get to help customers improve their software release processes.

I am a husband and father. I enjoy making things like delicious food, woodworking, electronics and haunted houses.
